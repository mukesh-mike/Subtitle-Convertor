00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,002
hello grammarians today we're going to
be talking about the irregular plural

2
00:00:04,002 --> 00:00:09,087
previously I had said that if you take
any English word any noun say the word

3
00:00:09,087 --> 00:00:15,175
dog and you tackiness onto the end of it
like so you get the word dogs and that's

4
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:23,075
how you form the plural in all cases I
was lying sorry it turns out that

5
00:00:23,075 --> 00:00:25,138
English is a little bit more complicated
than that
